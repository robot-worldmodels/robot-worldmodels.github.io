    <h2>Robot World Models</h2>
    <h4>RSS 2026 Workshop</h4>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="row main-content">
  <p><b><mark>Call for Papers</mark></b>
    We are sourcing two different types of papers: four-page papers and one-page abstracts, focusing on robot world models. Specific topics of interest include:
    <ul>
      <li>Action-conditioned world models</li>
      <li>Model-based reinforcement learning and long-horizon planning</li>
      <li>Differentiable simulation for control and decision-making</li>
      <li>Learning dynamics and physical interactions from data</li>
      <li>Sim-to-real transfer and robustness</li>
      <li>Evaluation of world models in robotics contexts</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p><b> Submission Policy: </b></p>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>We encourage two types of submissions:
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Novel Papers:</strong> 4-page submissions presenting new perspectives or experimental results. Should contain up to 4 pages of main paper plus any number of pages for references and supplementary material.</li>
        <li><strong>Abstracts from previously published work:</strong> One-page abstracts summarizing work that has already been published or accepted at other venues. The abstract should highlight the main contributions and explain the relevance to the workshop topic. Please also include a link to the online proceedings page for the original publication.</li>
      </ol>
    <li>We ask authors to use the supplementary material only for minor details that do not fit in the main paper. We reserve the right to desk reject papers that strongly violate this format (e.g., more than 4 pages of main content before references)</li>
    <li>4-page submissions should be fully anonymized for double-blind review.</li>
    <li>Accepted submissions will appear on the workshop website (non-archival).</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
